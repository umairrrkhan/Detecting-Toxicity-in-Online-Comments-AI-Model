## Introduction
Welcome to the Detecting Toxicity in Online Comments project! This ongoing project aims to build an AI model that can automatically detect toxic and harmful content in online comments. The goal is to create a system that can help online platforms to monitor and moderate user-generated content effectively.

Toxicity in online comments is a significant issue, impacting the safety, well-being, and user experience of people participating in online communities. Using machine learning and natural language processing techniques, we aim to identify harmful content and take appropriate actions to mitigate its impact.

## Dataset
The project utilizes the Kaggle dataset "Toxic Comment Classification Challenge" as the primary data source. You can find the dataset on Kaggle at the following link:
[Link to Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge)

The Kaggle dataset contains comments from various online platforms, labeled as toxic or non-toxic. We will preprocess and vectorize the comments to train our AI model to predict toxicity accurately.

## Project Status
Please note that this project is ongoing and not completed yet. We are actively working on building and fine-tuning the AI model to achieve better results. You are welcome to contribute to the project, and your contributions are highly appreciated.

## Installation
To run this project on your machine, you will need the following libraries installed:
- TensorFlow
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Gradio
- Matplotlib

You can install these libraries using `pip` with the following command:
```bash
pip install tensorflow pandas numpy gradio matplotlib
```

## Usage

To use the AI model for toxicity detection, you can follow the steps below:

- Clone the project repository to your local machine.
- Install the required libraries as mentioned in the Installation section.
- Download the Kaggle dataset from the provided link and place it in the appropriate directory.
- Run the provided scripts to preprocess the data, build the AI model, and evaluate its performance.
- Integrate the AI model into your online platform or use it to analyze comments for toxicity.
- Please note that additional steps, such as fine-tuning the model or exploring different architectures, can be taken to improve the model's performance 
  further.
